### Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the book "Haskell
Programming from First Principles"

### Usage

1. Install Haskell with [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
2. Start the REPL with `stack ghci`
    1. `:?` to display available commands
    2. `:q` to quit GHCi
    3. `:l test.hs` to load the specified module(s)
    4. `:i something` to display information about a given name (class,
       constructor, function)
    5. `:t something` to display the type of something
    6. `:m` to unload all modules (useful to start from fresh)
